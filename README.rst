***********************************************************
CSCI-442 - Project 5 - A Simple Memory Management Simulator
***********************************************************

1) Introduction
===============

For this project, you will implement a simulation of an operating
system’s memory manager. The simulation will read files representing the
process images of various processes, then replay a set of virtual
address references to those processes using one of two different
replacement strategies. The output will be various statistics, including
the number of memory accesses, page faults, and free frames remaining in
the system.

This project must be implemented in C++, and it must execute correctly
on Isengard although feel free to develop on your local machine!

2) Deliverable
===============

-  All unit tests in the starter code pass when running ``make test``.

-  The replacement strategy can be specified using the ``-–strategy``
   flag (Section 7, Section 10).

-  The maximum number of frames a process may use is configurable using
   the ``–-max-frames`` flag (Section 6, Section 10).

-  All required information is present in the output as specified in
   Section 8.

-  Details about individual memory accesses are correctly displayed when
   the ``–-verbose`` flag is set (Section 8).
   
-  Pass all tests ``./test-my-work.sh``.

Examples of the correct output for this deliverable are provided with
the starter code.

3) Grading
==========

Grading for this project will be based on:

* Passing unit tests

* Output matching provided examples

* Output matching "hidden" grader test cases

**It is vital that you follow all output requirements as
mentioned in Section 8.**

* Given that you have been provided with example outputs and a script to help you verify your program’s outputs, no tolerance will be made for programs that do not abide by these output formatting rules and examples.

Make sure all debugging and other non-required print statements have
been commented out before submitting your deliverables.

4) Requirements and Reference
=============================

- You are **required** to use the starter code provided for this project.

-  To compile your code, the grader should be able to ``cd`` into it and
   simply type ``make``. Typing ``make test`` should run the unit tests,
   all of which should pass. The grader must be able to do this using
   the ``Makefile`` that is provided with the starter code.

-  The grader must be able to execute your program by typing
   ``./mem-sim`` from the root of your repository.

-  Do not modify the directory structure provided in the starter code.

-  Your project must execute correctly on Isengard.

-  As long as they are present on Isengard, you are
   encouraged to use any C++ standard libraries you may find useful, such as
   ``<bitset>``, ``<map>``, ``<queue>``, etc.

-  Use good formatting skills. A well formatted project will not only be
   easier to work in and debug, but it will also make for a happier
   grader.

6) Getting Started
==================

You have been provided with starter code that has some
basic functionality implemented and a set of unit tests to help you with
implementing the project. The starter code implements command line flag
parsing and simulation file parsing, in addition to functionality from
data structures that were required to implement these features. However
you will still need to complete the implementation of many of the
included data structures.

The starter code already has a ``Makefile`` that builds everything under
the ``src/`` directory, placing temporary files in a bin directory and
the program itself (named ``mem-sim`` by default) in the root of the
repository. It also includes a ``make test`` target that will
automatically build all ``_tests.cpp`` files placed anywhere under the
``src/`` directory.

It has numerous classes declared that attempt to model the various
concepts in memory management you’ll need. Most are located in
subdirectories of the ``src/`` directory. Your first task should be to
skim through these files to get a handle on what is provided for you.

All methods that are declared in a header file have a stub
implementation in their corresponding ``.cpp`` files. Most of these
functions have unit tests already written for them, and you will be
required to implement the function stubs such that all the tests pass.
You are free to add additional methods and unit tests how ever you see
fit.

The starter code has already implemented the flag parsing functionality,
and within the ``Simulation`` class there exists an implementation of a
``print_summary`` function that should be used once you have populated
the ``Simulation`` class with the correct variables and functions.

6.1) Where to Start?
--------------------

It is recommended that you start the project by implementing the
functionality for the various classes that have been provided for you.
You are able to check your work on your implementations using the
provided unit testing functionality, discussed in the following section.

Many of these data structures are dependent on each other. For example,
think about the relationship between virtual addresses and physical
addresses, or pages, page tables, and processes. Thinking about these
things, perhaps drawing a diagram to see how they all fit together, will
help you better understand how to implement the project. This will also
help you better understand how all these pieces need to fit together for
your operating system to perform memory management.

While the command line flag parsing functionality has been implemented
for you, you should take a look at the ``FlagOptions`` struct that
stores information retrieved from command line input. This struct is
passed into the ``Simulation`` class via its constructor, and the values
contained in it should be used for various aspects of your simulation.
For example, the ``FlagOptions`` struct contains variables that let you
know if you should be printing the verbose output (Section 8), 
what the maximum number of frames for a process
should be (Section 6), or what replacement strategy
you should be using (Section 7).

6.2) Unit Tests
---------------

The starter code contains a number of unit tests to help you implement
the various data structures in the project. To run the tests, run the
following from within your repository:

``make test``

Most of them will fail until you implement the corresponding
functionality. You can run only certain tests by executing the
``make test`` command with a ``TEST_FILTER`` option:

``make test TEST_FILER="Test Case Pattern"``

For example, to run only the ``Process`` class’s test cases, you would
type:

``make test TEST_FILTER="Process*"``

To run a specific test, say the ``TotalSize`` test from the ``Process``
test cases, you would type:

``make test TEST_FILTER="Process.TotalSize"``

6.3) Output Testing
-------------------

The starter code also has example outputs and a script that you can run
to verify your solution with the provided outputs. The example outputs
themselves are located under ``tests/``, and the verification script is
named ``test-my-work.sh``.

To use the script, from the root of your repository, type these commands
into your terminal of choice:

::

   chmod +x test-my-work.sh
   ./test-my-work.sh

The ``chmod +x`` command only needs to be run once per computer.

The sections below discuss the more technical aspects of the project, so
it is suggested that you read them carefully.

7) Simulation Properties
========================

Your program will simulate memory management for a hypothetical computer
system with the following attributes:

#. Pages and frames are both **64 bytes** in size.

#. Main memory consists of **512 frames** for a total of 32 kilobytes of
   storage.

#. Addresses are **16 bits long**, with the ten most-significant bits
   representing the page or frame and the six least-significant
   representing the offset.

#. The maximum number of frames allocated to a process is static.
   Processes may be allocated frames until either reaching this limit or
   the system runs out of free frames to allocate.

#. The default maximum number of frames is 10, however the user may
   input a maximum frames value when executing the simulation (Section 10).

#. All frames in main memory are available for use by user processes;
   the OS does not occupy any memory (unlike a real computer).

#. Page tables do not occupy main memory, and reading from a page table
   does not constitute a memory access.

#. No translation look-aside buffer exists, so you do not need to
   simulate one.

#. Processes exist for the entire duration of the simulation; if you’ve
   done the last memory access for a given process as specified in the
   file, it continues to occupy its current frames for the remainder of
   the simulation.

#. Segmentation faults (memory access faults) are fatal and should cause the
   simulation to exit immediately.

   -  There are two kinds of segfaults: invalid page segfaults, and
      invalid offset segfaults.
      
    - Invalid page segfaults occur when a process is trying to access a page that it does not have access
      to.
      
    - Invalid offset segfaults occur when a process is trying to
      access an offset that does not exist as valid data in a given
      frame. 

#. If a process has not reached its maximum number of allocated frames,
   it should pick the first available frame.

#. The replacement strategies in the simulation are *local* replacement
   strategies. Once a process has reached its maximum number of
   allocated frames, it needs to pick one of its pages that is in main
   memory to replace.

8) Replacement Strategies
=========================

Your memory management simulation must support two different
page-replacement strategies: FIFO and LRU. Which strategy to use should
be provided as a command-line flag, as discussed in Section 10.

Both of these strategies should be implemented as they are described in
your textbook. While LRU is not feasible to implement in real operating
systems, your simulation has no such problem. You are free to keep track
of whatever you need to implement the two required strategies,
regardless of how feasible the collection of that data would be in a
real OS.

9) Required Output
==================

Examples of all outputs can be found within the starter code under
``tests/``.

9.1) Not Implemented for you
----------------------------

``–verbose``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``–-verbose`` or ``-v`` is specified, your simulation must output
information about each memory reference. The required information is as
follows:

-  The ID of the process making the memory reference.

-  The virtual address being accessed.

-  Whether the memory access resulted in a page fault or not.

-  The physical address corresponding to the virtual address.

-  The process’ current resident set size (RSS).

Here is an example of what this should look like for one memory
reference:

::

   PID 10 @ 0000010011101111 [page: 19; offset: 47]
       -> PAGE FAULT
       -> physical address 0000000000101111 [frame: 0; offset: 47]
       -> RSS: 1     

It is recommended that you take advantage of the ``<<`` operator
overloads written for the virtual and physical address classes when
printing this information.

9.2) Implemented For You
------------------------

This section is provided for your reference. All the logging and output
functionality in this section has been written for you.

Unless the ``–-csv`` or ``--c`` flag is input, your program should always
output this information to the screen:

-  The total number of memory accesses.

-  The total number of page faults.

-  The number of free frames remaining.

-  For each process:

   -  Total number of memory accesses.

   -  Total number of page faults.

   -  The percent of memory accesses that caused a page fault.

   -  The resident set size of the process at the end of the simulation.

Here is an example of how this should look:

::

   Process  10:  ACCESSES: 30     FAULTS: 19     FAULT RATE: 63.33    RSS: 10    
   Process  42:  ACCESSES: 31     FAULTS: 29     FAULT RATE: 93.55    RSS: 10    
   Process  99:  ACCESSES: 53     FAULTS: 53     FAULT RATE: 100.00   RSS: 10    

   Total memory accesses:             114
   Total page faults:                 101
   Free frames remaining:             482


10) Simulation File Format
==========================

This section is provided as a reference. All the file input parsing has
been written for you.

The simulation file specifies both the set of processes that are
currently active in the system and the sequence of virtual addresses
that should be accessed. Its format is as follows:

.. code:: default

   num processes
   process_id process_file         // The process ID and corresponding process image file
   process_id process_file         // The process ID and corresponding process image file

   process_id virtual_address      // PID of process and the address being accessed
   process_id virtual_address      // PID of process and the address being accessed
   process_id virtual_address      // PID of process and the address being accessed
   process_id virtual_address      // PID of process and the address being accessed
   ...                             // Keep reading until EOF

Here is an example. Note that the comments won’t be in the actual files.

.. code:: default

   2                       // 2 processes active in the system
   10 process 1.txt        // Process with PID 10 and file containing its process image
   42 process 2.txt        // Process with PID 42 and file containing its process image

   10 0010000110011001     // Process 10 accesses address 0010000110011001
   10 0010000110011010     // Process 10 accesses address 0010000110011010
   10 0010000110011011     // Process 10 accesses address 0010000110011011
   42 0110000110011001     // Process 42 accesses address 0110000110011001
   42 0100000110011010     // Process 42 accesses address 0100000110011010
   10 0010000110011001     // Process 10 accesses address 0010000110011001
   ...                     // Keep reading until EOF

The first line specifies the number of processes active in the system.
You can use this value to control how many subsequent values you
interpret as processes.

Each process has both a process ID and a file that contains the data
that should be used as its process image. The file should be assumed to
be in binary format, though you can read each byte into a ``char``
array. The "process file" field is the filename of the process image. It
is a filename that points to the location of the process image relative
to the location of the ``mem-sim`` binary file that you run using
``./mem-sim``.

The starter code contains an example simulation file, as well as a few
dummy process images under the ``inputs/`` directory.

.. _sec:flags:

11) Command-Line Flags
======================

This section is provided as a reference. All the command line input
parsing has been written for you.

Your program must support invocation in the format specified below,
including the following command-line flags:

::

   ./mem-sim [flags] simulation_file.txt

   -v, --verbose
       Output information about every memory access.

   -s, --strategy <FIFO | LRU>
       The replacement strategy to use. One of FIFO or LRU.

   -f, --max-frames [positive integer]
       The maximum number of frames a process may be allocated.
       
   -i, --file-verbose,
       Print process size and virtual addresses when reading in file.
       
   -h --help
       Display a help message about these flags and exit

``-c, -–csv``
-------------

The output required for the ``–-csv`` flag is described in Section 8.

``-v, -–verbose``
-----------------

The output required for the ``–-verbose`` flag is described in Section 8.

``-s, –-strategy <FIFO | LRU>``
-------------------------------

This flag determines the replacement strategy that your simulation must
use when either a process has been allocated the maximum number of
frames (determined by ``–-max-frames``) or the system has no free frames
available. A strategy must be supplied when using this flag. If this
flag is not provided, your program should default to using FIFO.

``-f, –-max-frames <positive integer>``
---------------------------------------

This flag requires a positive integer argument and specifies the maximum
number of frames that can be allocated to a single process, assuming the
system still has free frames available. If a process already has this
number of frames, or the system has no more free frames to spare, you
must replace one of the process’ other pages using the replacement
strategy specified by ``-–strategy`` to bring in a new page. If the flag
is not provided, it should default to 10.

``-h, –help``
-------------

The ``-–help`` flag must cause your program to print out instruction for
how to run your program and the flags it accepts and then
**immediately** exit.

12) Collaboration Policy
========================

This is an **individual project**.  All code you submit should be
written by yourself.  You should not share your code with others.

Please see the syllabus for the full collaboration policy.

.. warning::

   **Plagarism will be punished harshly!**

13) Access to Isengard
======================

Remote access to Isengard is quite similar to ALAMODE, but the
hostname is ``isengard.mines.edu``.

For example, to ``ssh`` into the machine with your campus MultiPass
login, use this command::

  $ ssh username@isengard.mines.edu

Note: you need to be on the campus network or VPN for this to work.
If you are working from home, use either the VPN or hop thru
``imagine.mines.edu`` first.
